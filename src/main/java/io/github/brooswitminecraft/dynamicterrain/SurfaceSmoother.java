/**
 * Pure math for worldgen smoothing. A column's natural surface is an integer
 * height S (the top of its highest solid block). The smoothed surface is a
 * fractional height T: a 3x3 weighted average of the natural heights around
 * the column, kept within 15/16 of S so a column never moves by a whole block.
 * T is then expressed as the cell that holds the surface and how many sixteenths
 * of that cell are filled.
 *
 * Because T depends only on natural heights, two adjacent chunks compute the
 * same T along their shared edge, so the seam stays seamless.
