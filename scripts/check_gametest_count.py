"""Fail closed on a GameTest server run that silently did nothing.

Gradle reports BUILD SUCCESSFUL even when the GameTest server fails to start
or ran zero tests, so a green `./gradlew runGameTestServer` exit code alone
proves nothing. This checks the run's own log for unambiguous evidence: the
server must not have failed to start, there must be no reported
required-test failures, and the completed/passed counts must both exactly
equal the number of acceptance tests this mod declares (MINECRAFT-499).

Pattern adapted from layered-slopes' own guard of the same name, which found
(via an actual CI run) that this NeoForge version's GameTestServer log only
ever names FAILING tests; passing tests are only counted, never individually
named. Matching the exact expected count is the strongest check this log
format actually supports.
